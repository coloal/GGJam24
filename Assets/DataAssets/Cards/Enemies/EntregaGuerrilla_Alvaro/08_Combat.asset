  OnStartConversation:
  - What a thrill. This feels like when I gave it my all when I was young!
  - (Okay, calm down, Bob, calm down... You're playing your ass off in front of these
    young men. Try to make it hard for them.)
  - Kids, you'd better hold on to something, because there are curves coming!!!!
  OnWinConversation:
  - It was a formidable fight, kids. You earned it. Have the best vacation of your
    life!
  - (Of course, if any accident happens, I don't want to know anything about it...)
  OnLoseConversation:
  - You lack determination, kids! Train harder and come back stronger to challenge
    me!
