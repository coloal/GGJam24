  initialConversation:
  - "Let\xB4s fight! No physical touch though."
  - Here you will have to battle against your opponents.
  - In a *<b>CARD GAME!</b>*
  - As it is your first time here, i will be guiding you through the combat.
  - First we are gonna take a look at the cards present in this universe.
  cardExplanation:
  - This are the cards you will encounter during your adventure.
  - There are three types of cards. Each one respresented by a different color. (Card
    objects do not affect gameplay.)
  - So now. How do you win? (*or lose probably...*)
  - This three cards will interact differently between each other.
  - The <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card will beat the  <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color>
    card but will lose to the <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card.
  - The <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> card will beat the <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color>
    card but will lose to the <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card.
  - The <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card will beat the <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color>
    card but will lose to the <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> card.
  - "Now that we know all of the cards let\xB4s start with the combat!"
  bookExplanation:
  - You can always see which card wins or loses trades in the notebook over here.
  enemyCardExplanationPreShow:
  - "Right at the very start of each combat the enemy will show you it\xB4s cards."
  enemyCardExplanationWhileShow:
  - These are the cards I will use in this combat.
  - It would be nice if you try to remember them (or else you will probably *lose*...)
  - But be careful as the cards that your opponent is gonna use are not in the same
    order as you are seeing them here.
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceWin:
  - I will now play one of my cards. And you will not be able to see what card i
    picked so be prepared to *LOSE!*
  - What? You wanna know what cards I picked only because this is the tutorial?!?!?!
  - ....................
  - '*.......*'
  - 'Okay, okay, you win... I''m gonna tell you the cards that I''m picking *:(* '
  - The card I'm gonna pick first is a *<color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color>* card.
  playerPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceWin:
  - "Ok so now it\xB4s your turn!"
  - You will have to pick one of your cards to fight with mine.
  - "Remember, you normally wouldn\xB4t know which card I just picked."
  - So if you wanna win you should maybe play a <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card.
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceLose:
  - I will play my <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card again, maybe this time I
    will have more luck.
  playerPlaysCardExplanationMoneyLose:
  - I would highly recommend you to use your <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> card (It's
    not like you are gonna *LOSE* or anything...)
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationMoneyDraw:
  - I will spice things up and play a  <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> card.
  playerPlaysCardExplanationMoneyDraw:
  - 'I think you should also play a <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> card. '
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceDraw:
  - Next I will play a <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card.
  playerPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceDraw:
  - And you will also have to pick you <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card.
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceDraw:
  - I only have one card left. Do you know which type is it?
  - "If you don\xB4t, that means that you *haven't been playing this game properly.*"
  - It is really important to keep track of the cards the enemy has to be able to
    face them in a more accurate way.
  - "So if you didn\xB4t already know, my last card is a <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color>
    card."
  playerPlaysCardExplanationViolenceDraw:
  - You only have one card left so there is nothing you can do other than playing
    your <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card.
  winExplanation:
  - '*NOOOO!* Bro you just *killed* my card >:('
  - So yeah, you have won the exchange, as a <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> card beats
    a <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card.
  - Now your card will return to your deck, and my card will be destroyed.
  loseExplanation:
  - '*Yes*, I have won!!'
  - And you have lost the exchange.
  - Your card will now be destroyed and mine will return to my hand.
  - "But don\xB4t worry, your card will become avaliable in the next combat."
  drawExplanationFirst:
  - Our cards have tied the exchange as the types of both are the same.
  - Both cards will be put apart until someone wins the exchange.
  - You will not draw any new card from your deck until the draw is resolved.
  drawExplanationSecond:
  - Our cards have tied again.
  - Both cards will be put on top of the previous ones.
  drawExplanationThird:
  - Again! Our cards have tied for a third time.
  - Both cards will be put on the previous ones.
  coinCardExplanation:
  - Wait, what do we do now?
  - "I don\xB4t have any cards left in my deck..."
  - "And you don\xB4t have any in your hand."
  - ...... Yeah, I know what we could do!!!
  - We just throw a coin to solve the tie situation.
  - I mean, who doesn't like a bit of *gambling*-I mean... Luck in the game!
  - ... So we will have to throw a coin whenever the player or the enemy run out
    of cards.
  - Ok, make you choice then. *<color="purple">HEADS</color>* or *<color="purple">TAILS</color>?*
  coinExplanation:
  - Now the coin will be thrown. Good luck (to me).
  battleResultExplanation:
  - Congrats!! You have won the combat!!! (If only this wasnt scripted*...*)
  pickWinCardExplanation:
  - As the winner you have gained the right to keep one of my precious cards. Choose
    wisely as you can only pick once.
  endExplanation:
  - The combat has reached its end. Good luck destroying the rest of your oponents
    (or being destoyed by them).
  playerTrippingViolence:
  - I think you made a mistake, you have to play your <color=#438c1d>*WEALTH*</color>
    card to fight against my <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color> card.
  playerTrippingViolence_1:
  - '%I SAID PLAY YOUR <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> CARD!!!%'
  playerTrippingViolence_2:
  - '%IF YOU DONT PLAY YOUR <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> CARD I WILL SHOW YOU REAL
    <color=#bc3047>VIOLENCE</color>!!!!!!%'
  playerTrippingMoney:
  - Wrong choice. *Try again*
  playerTrippingMoney_1:
  - '%YOU REALLY SHOULD JUST PLAY YOUR <color=#438c1d>WEALTH</color> CARD.%'
  playerTrippingMoney_2:
  - '%ARE YOU SO POOR YOU CANT EVEN PLAY A CARD THAT HAS MONEY IN IT!!!??%'
  playerTrippingInfluence:
  - I think you made a slight *mistake*. Playing your *<color=#2c7aab>POWER</color>*
    card is the way to go here.
  playerTrippingInfluence_1:
  - '%PLEASE, DO ME A FAVOR AND USE THE TWO REMAINING NEURONS YOU HAVE LEFT TO PLAY
    THE <color=#2c7aab>POWER</color> CARD.%'
  playerTrippingInfluence_2:
  - '%OK, I GOT IT..... YOU ARE POWERLESS AND HAVE NO FRIENDS.%'
  playerTrippingFinal:
  - '*NO*, this is not the card i said.'
  playerTrippingFinal_1:
  - Are you *TRIPPING BRO*?
  playerTrippingFinal_2:
  - '%Lorem ipsu bla bla bla%'
