  initialConversation:
  - "Let\xB4s fight! No physical touch though"
  - Here you will have to battle against your opponents
  - In a *CARD GAME!*
  - As it is your first time here, i will be guiding you through the combat
  - First we are gonna take a look at the cards present in this universe
  cardExplanation:
  - This are the cards you will encounter during your adventure
  - There are three types of cards. Each one respresented by a different color. (Card
    objects do not affect gameplay)
  - The RED card stands for VIOLENCE
  - The GREEN card stands for WEALTH
  - And finally the BLUE card stands for POWER
  - So now. How do you win? (*or lose probably...*)
  - This three cards will interact differently between each other
  - The *VIOLENCE* card (red) will beat the WEALTH (green) card but will lose to
    the POWER (blue) card
  - The WEALTH (green) card will beat the POWER (blue) card but will lose to the
    VIOLENCE (red) card
  - The POWER (blue) card will beat the VIOLENCE (red) card but will lose to the
    WEALTH (green) card
  - "Now that we know all of the cards let\xB4s start with the combat!"
  enemyCardExplanationPreShow:
  - "Rigth at the very start of each combat the enemy will show you it\xB4s cards"
  enemyCardExplanationWhileShow:
  - These are the cards I will use in this combat.
  - It would be nice if you try to remember them (or else you will probably *lose*...)
  - But be careful as the cards that your opponent is gonna use are not in the same
    order as you are seeing them here
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceWin:
  - I will now play one of my cards. And you will not be able to see what card i
    picked so be prepared to *LOSE!*
  - What? You wanna know what cards i picked only because this is the tutorial?!?!?!
  - ....................
  - '*.......*'
  - 'Okay okay, you win, im gonna tell you the cards that im picking *:(* '
  - "The card I\xB4m gonna pick first is a *VIOLENCE* card"
  playerPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceWin:
  - "Ok so now it\xB4s your turn!"
  - You will have to pick one of your cards to figth with mine
  - "Remember, you normally wouldn\xB4t know which card I just picked"
  - So if you wanna win you should maybe play a POWER card
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceLose:
  - I will play my VIOLENCE card again, maybe this time I will have more luck
  playerPlaysCardExplanationMoneyLose:
  - I would highly recomend you to use your WEALTH card (Its not like you are gonna
    *LOSE* or anything...)
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationMoneyDraw:
  - I will spice thing up and play a WEALTH card
  playerPlaysCardExplanationMoneyDraw:
  - 'I think you should also play a WEALTH card. '
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceDraw:
  - Next I will play a POWER card
  playerPlaysCardExplanationInfluenceDraw:
  - 'And you will also have to pick you POWER card '
  enemyPlaysCardExplanationViolenceDraw:
  - I only have one card left. Do you know which type is it?
  - "If you don\xB4t, that means that you *havent been playing this game properly*"
  - It is really important to keep track of the cards the enemy has to be able to
    face them in a more accurate way.
  - "So if you didn\xB4t already know, my last card is a VIOLENCE card"
  playerPlaysCardExplanationViolenceDraw:
  - You only have one card left so there is nothing you can do other than playing
    your VIOLENCE card
  winExplanation:
  - '*NOO!*, bro you just *killed* my card  >:('
  - So yeah, you have won the exchange, as a POWER card beats a VIOLENCE Card
  - 'Now your card will return to your deck, and my card will be destroyed '
  loseExplanation:
  - '*Yes*, I have won!!'
  - And you have lost the exchange
  - Your card will now be destroyed and mine will return to my hand
  drawExplanationFirst:
  - Our cards have tied the exchange as the types of both are the same
  - Both cards will be put apart until someone wins the exchange
  - You will not draw any new card from your deck until the draw is resolved
  drawExplanationSecond:
  - 'Our cards have tied again '
  - Both cards will be put on top of the previous ones
  drawExplanationThird:
  - Again! Our cards have tied for a third time
  - Both cards will be put on the previous ones
  coinCardExplanation:
  - Wait, what do we do now?
  - "I don\xB4t have any cards left in my deck..."
  - "And you don\xB4t have any in your hand"
  - ...... Yeah I know what we could do!!!
  - We just throw a coin to solve the tie situation
  - I mean who doesnt like a bit of *gambling* I mean luck in the game
  - ... So we will have to throw a coin whenever the player or the enemy run out
    of cards
  - Ok, make you choice then. *HEADS* or *TAILS?*
  coinExplanation:
  - Now the coin will be thrown. Good luck (to me)
  battleResultExplanation:
  - Congrats!! You have won the combat!!! (If only this wasnt scripted*...*)
  pickWinCardExplanation:
  - As the winner you have gained the rigth to keep one of my precious cards. Choose
    wisely as you can only pick once.
  endExplanation:
  - The combat has reached its end. Good luck destroying the rest of your oponents
    (or being destoyed by them)
  playerTrippingViolence:
  - I think you made a mistake, you have to play your *WEALTH* card to figth against
    my VIOLENCE card
  playerTrippingViolence_1:
  - '%SAID PLAY YOUR WEALTH CARD!!!%'
  playerTrippingViolence_2:
  - '%IF YOU DONT PLAY YOUR WEALTH CARD I WILL SHOW YOU REAL VIOLENCE!!!!!!%'
  playerTrippingMoney:
  - Wrong choice. *Try again*
  playerTrippingMoney_1:
  - '%YOU REALLY SHOULD JUST PLAY YOUR WEALTH CARD%'
  playerTrippingMoney_2:
  - '%ARE YOU SO POOR YOU CANT EVEN PLAY A CARD THAT HAS MONEY IN IT!!!??%'
  playerTrippingInfluence:
  - I think you made a slight *mistake*. Playing your *POWER* card is the way to
    go here
  playerTrippingInfluence_1:
  - '%PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR AND USE THE TWO REMAINING NEURONS YOU HAVE LEFT TO PLAY
    THE POWER CARD. %'
  playerTrippingInfluence_2:
  - '%OK, I GOT IT..... YOU ARE POWERLESS AND HAVE NO FRIENDS%'
